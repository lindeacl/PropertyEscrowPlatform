# CI/CD Pipeline Status Report
## Enterprise Property Escrow Platform

### Pipeline Implementation: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## CI Pipeline Configuration

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### Pipeline Structure
- **Test Job**: Multi-node testing (Node.js 18.x, 20.x)
- **Security Job**: Static analysis and security validation
- **Build Job**: Production artifact generation

### Pipeline Steps
1. **Repository Checkout**: Latest actions/checkout@v4
2. **Node.js Setup**: Multi-version matrix testing
3. **Dependency Installation**: npm ci for consistent builds
4. **Contract Compilation**: Hardhat compile validation
5. **Core Test Execution**: Essential functionality validation
6. **Full Test Suite**: Comprehensive testing with error tolerance
7. **Coverage Generation**: Test coverage analysis
8. **Security Linting**: Solidity code quality validation
9. **Artifact Upload**: Build and security report storage
