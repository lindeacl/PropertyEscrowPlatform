Tooltips for advanced blockchain terms or actions

7. Microcopy & Voice
Friendly but professional:

“Your funds are securely escrowed.”

“Raise a dispute—don’t worry, we’ll help resolve it.”

“Waiting for the seller to upload documents.”

Avoid jargon—explain blockchain terms when first used

Loading:

Use animated skeletons or spinners, never block whole page unless unavoidable

Audit log page:

Timeline of every escrow-related action, with clickable transaction hashes

Dark mode toggle:

Persist choice in local storage

9. Dev Implementation Guidelines
Use React (or preferred modern framework)

Use Tailwind CSS or CSS-in-JS for theme consistency

Use state management (Redux, Zustand, or Context)

Integrate WalletConnect, MetaMask modules for web3 actions

Use TypeScript for all new UI components

Final Words for the Dev Agent
Every user touchpoint should say: “Your money is safe. Your experience is seamless. This is enterprise-grade escrow.” Don’t over-design—be clear, bold, and frictionless.
