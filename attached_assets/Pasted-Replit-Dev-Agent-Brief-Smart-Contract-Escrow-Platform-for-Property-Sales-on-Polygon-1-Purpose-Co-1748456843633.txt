Replit Dev Agent Brief: Smart Contract Escrow Platform for Property Sales on Polygon
1. Purpose & Core Requirements
Objective:
Build a smart contract-based escrow platform on Polygon (EVM-compatible, ERC20) to facilitate secure, transparent property sales. The platform must allow intake of various payment forms (including cash equivalents) as part of the escrow process, with enterprise readiness as a non-negotiable.

Key Capabilities:

Escrow smart contract manages buyer/seller/property/agent relationships

Supports deposit, lock, and release of funds (ERC20 and potentially other forms)

Handles multi-step property sale flows: deposit, verification, conditional release, dispute resolution, and refunds

Auditability, clear state transitions, and secure role-based access

Designed for integration with external payment rails for fiat on/off-ramp

2. High-Level Design Principles
Security First: Prevent re-entrancy, unauthorized access, double spend, and front-running

Transparency: All contract state transitions must be auditable on-chain

Modular and Upgradeable: Separate contract logic, storage, and interfaces; consider using proxies if upgradeability is required

Compliance Ready: Log all actions and include hooks for compliance checks (e.g., KYC)

Gas Efficiency: Optimize all contract operations for Polygon’s cost model

Fail-Safe: Funds must always be recoverable in case of any failure or dispute

Extensible Payment Methods: Out of the box ERC20 support, but interfaces for integrating with fiat gateways (can stub for now)

3. Test and Validation Requirements
Test-Driven Development (TDD):

Unit Tests: 100% coverage for all smart contract functions (use Hardhat or Foundry testing suite)

Integration Tests: Simulate end-to-end property sale flows, including edge cases (failed payments, disputes, etc.)

Security Tests: Include attack simulations (re-entrancy, overflow, access control)

Regression Tests: For every new feature or fix, regression tests must be written and tracked

Static Analysis: Run Slither, MythX, or equivalent for vulnerability scanning

Audit-Ready:

Follow OpenZeppelin contract standards

Document all interfaces, roles, and security considerations

4. Core Smart Contract Features
Property Escrow Lifecycle:

Escrow Creation: Seller (or platform) lists property, sets terms

Deposit Funds: Buyer deposits ERC20 tokens (or other supported forms) into escrow

Verification: Optional third-party (agent, platform, etc.) verifies off-chain conditions (e.g., property inspection, paperwork)

Release Conditions: On successful verification, funds are released to the seller. If dispute, a resolution flow is triggered.

Refunds: Buyer can be refunded if sale conditions are not met (with agreed rules)

Dispute Resolution: Built-in, with roles for trusted arbiters or platform

Roles & Permissions:

Buyer, Seller, Escrow Agent/Arbiter, Admin

Only authorized parties can trigger sensitive functions

Events & Logging:

Emit detailed events for all state changes (escrow creation, deposit, release, dispute, refund, etc.)

5. Enterprise-Readiness Checklist
Comprehensive README with architecture, deployment, and integration docs

Full test suite with >90% coverage and automated CI for deployments

Well-documented API and smart contract interfaces

Compliance hooks for KYC/AML if needed (stub if not full implementation)

Upgradeable contracts if required (optional—confirm with product owner)

Production deployment scripts for Polygon mainnet/testnet

Monitoring and alerting hooks (emit events for off-chain monitoring)

6. Deliverables
Smart Contract Codebase (Solidity, OpenZeppelin standards)

Deployment Scripts (Hardhat, Foundry, or Truffle)

Comprehensive Unit & Integration Tests

Security Test Results and static analysis output

User & Developer Documentation (incl. how to interact, example flows)

Audit Preparation Package: Full documentation, threat model, test results

Optional: Minimal UI/CLI for demoing basic flows

7. Forward-Thinking Notes
Design for multi-property and multi-escrow support

Prepare for off-chain integration: Notarization, document upload, KYC, fiat on-ramp/off-ramp (future)

Scalability: Consider using subgraphs (The Graph) or similar for property and escrow indexing

Summary for Dev Agent
"Deliver an enterprise-grade, fully tested escrow platform on Polygon for property sales, with security, extensibility, and auditable flows at its core. Don’t cut corners—think like an auditor, build like a Fintech startup, and test like a paranoid engineer. Use best-in-class frameworks and make sure every major business risk (fraud, dispute, funds lock, compliance) is mitigated. Documentation and test evidence are part of the definition of done."
