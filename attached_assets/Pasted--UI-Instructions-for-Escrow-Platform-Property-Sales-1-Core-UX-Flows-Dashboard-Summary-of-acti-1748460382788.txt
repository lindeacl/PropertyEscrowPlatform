🟦 UI Instructions for Escrow Platform (Property Sales)
1. Core UX Flows
Dashboard:

Summary of active, pending, and historical escrow transactions

Quick actions: “Start New Escrow”, “View Properties”, “Withdraw Funds”, “Resolve Dispute”

Escrow Details Page:

Step-by-step timeline: Initiated → Deposited → Verified → Completed/Disputed

Key metadata: Property details, parties involved, funds status, contract address, state

Action buttons contextual to user role (Buyer/Seller/Agent/Admin)

Start Escrow Flow:

Simple, form-driven modal (choose property, set price, select counterparty)

Option to upload off-chain docs (KYC, property paperwork)

Deposit & Release:

Deposit funds (ERC20)—clear wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect)

Visual confirmation on-chain events

Dispute/Refund Flow:

“Raise Dispute” is visible but not in-your-face (nobody wants a panic button at eye-level)

Timeline view of dispute process

Notifications:

Toasts for transaction status, warnings, successes, errors

2. User Roles
Role-based views:

Buyers see “Deposit” & “Request Refund”

Sellers see “Release Funds” & “Mark as Complete”
